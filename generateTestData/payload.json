The agenda is set to be dominated by the war in Ukraine and calls for members to increase their spending on defence. US President Joe Biden - who faces domestic pressure over his age as he faces re-election later this year - has pledged more air defence systems for Ukraine. This year's gathering includes Sweden which abandoned its military neutrality to join Nato following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It's also new UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's first international summit since winning last week's general election."
